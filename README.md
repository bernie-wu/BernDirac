# BernDirac
A Mathematica package for doing quantum mechanics/quantum computing computation in the Dirac notation (i.e. ket and bra).

# Example
The only file you need is [BernDirac.wl](https://github.com/bernie-wu/BernDirac/blob/main/BernDirac.wl). A Mathematica notebook .nb file showing examples of how to use this package can be found in the [Example](https://github.com/bernie-wu/BernDirac/tree/main/Example) folder.

# Who am I and why did I create this package?
At the time of writing this I am a graduate student with homework assignments involved in heavy and tedious quantum mechanics calculations. I created this Mathematica package to ease my life. Since, it helped me a lot, I figured I should share this with the public too in case someone is also in the same boat as me.
